# razan-productivity-assistant
A quiet place to track learning, build consistency, and turn effort into something visible.

## What this is
This is a personal learning tracker built to encourage consistency without pressure.
Instead of focusing on productivity or speed, the app focuses on:
- Showing up daily
- Tracking effort honestly
- Visualizing progress over time

Inspired by GitHub’s contribution graph — but for learning.


## Why I’m building this
I wanted a tool that helps me:
- Track what I learn each day
- Stay consistent without burnout
- See progress visually, not emotionally

This project is also a way for me to:
- Practice building real-world apps
- Learn React and Firebase properly
- Improve slowly, intentionally, and consistently


## Core features (current & planned)
- Clean, minimal UI
- Daily task tracking
- GitHub-style contribution heatmap
- Streak tracking
- Dark-mode-first design

**Planned:**
- Time-based task tracking (focus sessions)
- Extendable learning sessions
- Weekly and monthly summaries
- Gentle insights (no pressure metrics)


## Tech stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore)  
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting  
- **Utilities:** date-fns
